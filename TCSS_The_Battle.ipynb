This project would use Four-square API as its prime data gathering source. Many organizations are using to geo-tag their photos with detailed info about a destination, while also serving up contextually relevant locations for those who are searching for a place to eat, drink or explore. \n\nAPI provides the ability to perform location search, location sharing and details about a business. Foursquare users can also use photos, tips and reviews in many productive ways to add value to the results. (Venues [Office Supplies, Stationery, Computer Shops], TOP tips, Favourites, User Experience, etc.),  Metro (distance) will be used to cluster, segment, target, and position to craft recommendations for the company management.\n\nwe will be conducting clustering and neighbourhood based analysis leveraging primarily Foursquare APIs and tools such as KNN and relevant Unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-mean clustering would be applied to form the clusters of different categories of places residing in and around the neighborhoods.\n\nFolium- Python visualization library would be used to visualize the neighborhoods cluster distribution of NY city over an interactive leaflet map. Using the data available in the above sources.\n\nExtensive comparative analysis of two randomly picked neighborhoods world be carried out to derive the desirable insights from the outcomes using python\u2019s scientific libraries Pandas, NumPy and Scikit-learn. \n\nThese clusters from each of those two chosen neighborhoods would be analyzed individually collectively and comparatively to derive the conclusions.",
